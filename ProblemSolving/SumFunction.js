// ===============================================================
// Write a function which takes two numbers and returns their sum
// ===============================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// Write a function that adds two numbers

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
// Integers? Floats? What about string for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
// Integers? Floats? What about string for large numbers?

// 4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?
// Depends! Will there always be two numbers? What if we only receive one, or more than two? What should we return?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?
// Should I label each number num1 & num2 and the sum "sum"?
